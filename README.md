Mini-Project First Batch: #3 Quantum Calculator
Gabriella Torres Nothaft

QCalc.py includes the code that outputs the quantum circuit, the code that outputs gate count, depth, and number of ancillas used, and sample test codes for both addition and multiplication.

References.md includes all the papers/books I used as reference while writing the code. I'm not sure if I cited it all correctly but the logic all comes from those papers



Note: This is my first time making a Github repo and I have been struggling a lot to make a jupyter notebook that opens properly. I appreciate the patience
